15th March 2021, I started the Zuri training cohort 1 as a backend trainee. 

This repo consists of my projects during the training.

This is the [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pE-jTcLXgY&list=PLxuUHF3OiqfWAITD4gPUHZ1GcYRqmyF7P) for the training's backend - python track

## Projects

### Mock ATM Project
   1. The user should see the current date and time after they log in
   
   2. When the user selects option 1, they should be presented with the following:
    
    - How much would you like to withdraw (receive input from the user), output "take your cash"

   3. When the user selects option 2, present them with the following options:
    
    - How much would you like to deposit? (receive input from the user), output current balance.

   4. When the user selects complaint, present them with the following options:
    
    - What issue will you like to report? (Receive input from the user), output "Thank you for contacting us"
   
   *I used lists, dictionary, if and else statement, string methods, input and arithmetic operands*

### [Budget App](https://github.com/PrechyDev/Zuri/blob/main/budget.py)
   Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects       should allow for
   1.  Depositing funds to each of the categories
   2.  Withdrawing funds from each category
   3.  Computing category balances
   4.  Transferring balance amounts between categories
